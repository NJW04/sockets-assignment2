For this assignment, we created a network communication application with the main purpose of facilitating multiple clients interaction on a local network. This was accomplished through a client to server interaction using a TCP connection. Which was utilised to gain necessary information, such as the other clients IP Address and Port Number in order to allow for a peer to peer communication, established by a UDP connection, to take place. When initially running the “Client.py”program, the user is prompted with two key options. Either they can join the server in which they can find information on active users and have interactions,or they can speak to users directly without the server; however this will require the sender to know the socket information of the receiver.
